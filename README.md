## Hamlisting.com

This is a Golang app built with the Beego framework. It is not yet complete, but does have some nice user/RBAC features. 

The eventual plan is for this to be a craigslist-like application specifically for ham radio equipment. The current classifieds sites that people use to get ham radio equipment are a bit limited. This application hopes to add richer search features and better user experience to the ham radio classifieds space.

Right now the only part that is implemented is the user/RBAC portion. The next phase will be to develop the actual listing functionality. However this project has been on hold for some time due to other obligations.
