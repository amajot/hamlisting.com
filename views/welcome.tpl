			<h3>Welcome to HamListings, your one stop for buying, selling, and trading amateur radio equipment online.</h3>
	</div>	
	<div class="row col-md-12">
			<p>At HamListings we allow you to post your equipment for sale online similar to Craigslist, swap.qth.com, or QRZ forums. But this site was specifically built with buying, selling, and trading ham radio gear in mind. It has much better filtering, searching, and usability compared to other online ham resources.</p> 

			<p>New features are being planned and developed all the time, so check back for more!</p>
